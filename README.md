Steam Trade Offers Client for Python
=======

`steampy` is a library for Python, inspired by node-steam-tradeoffers, node-steam and other libraries for Node.js.
It was designed as a simple lightweight library, combining features of many steam libraries from Node.js into a single python module.
`steampy` is capable of logging into steam, fetching trade offers and handling them in simple manner, using steam user credentials
and SteamGuard file(no need to extract and pass sessionID and webCookie).
`steampy` is developed with Python 3 using type hints and many other features.

Installation
============

```
pip install steampy
```

Usage
=======
[Obtaining API Key](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)

[Obtaining SteamGuard from mobile device]( https://github.com/SMVampire/SteamBotDev/wiki )

[Obtaining SteamGuard using Android emulation]( https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Genymotion-2.0-Emulators-with-Google-Play-support)

```
from steampy.client import SteamClient

steam_client = SteamClient('MY_API_KEY')
steam_client.login('MY_USERNAME', 'MY_PASSWORD', 'PATH_TO_STEAMGUARD_FILE')
```

Examples
========

You'll need to install obtain your API key and SteamGuard file in order to run the examples, 
ant then fill login and password in `storehose.py` file.
The `storehouse.py` file contains an example of handling incoming trade offers.

```
python storehouse.py
```

Methods
=======

Unless specified in documentation, the method does not require login to work(it uses API Key from constructor instead)


**login(username: str, password: str, steam_guard: str) -> requests.Response**

Log into the steam account. Allows to accept trade offers and some other methods.

```
from steampy.client import SteamClient

steam_client = SteamClient('MY_API_KEY')
steam_client.login('MY_USERNAME', 'MY_PASSWORD', 'PATH_TO_STEAMGUARD_FILE')
```

**api_call(request_method: str, interface: str, api_method: str, version: str, params: dict = None) -> requests.Response**

Directly call api method from the steam api services.

[Official steam api site](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API)

[Unofficial but more elegant](https://lab.xpaw.me/steam_api_documentation.html)

```
from steampy.client import SteamClient

steam_client = SteamClient('MY_API_KEY')
params = {'key': self._api_key}
summaries =  steam_client.api_call('GET', 'IEconService', 'GetTradeOffersSummary', 'v1', params).json()
```
**get_trade_offers_summary() -> dict**


**get_trade_offers() -> dict**

Fetching trade offers from steam using an API call.
Method is fetching offers with descriptions that satisfy conditions:
    * Are sent by us or others
    * Are active (means no historical, does not mean having offer state active!)
    * Are not historical
    * No time limitation
    
**get_trade_offer(trade_offer_id: str) -> dict**


**accept_trade_offer(trade_offer_id: str) -> dict**

Using `SteamClient.login` method is required before usage
This method also uses identity secret from SteamGuard file to confirm the trade offer.
No need to manually confirm it on mobile app or email.

**decline_trade_offer(trade_offer_id: str) -> dict**

Decline trade offer that **other** user sent to us.

**cancel_trade_offer(trade_offer_id: str) -> dict**

Cancel trade offer that **we** sent to other user.

**get_price(item_hash_name: str, game: GameOptions, currency: str = Currency.USD) -> dict**

Games are defined in GameOptions class, currently `GameOptions.DOTA2` and `GameOptions.CS`

Currencies are defined in Currency class, currently `Currency.USD`, `Currency.GBP`, `Currency.EURO`, `Currency.CHF`

Default currency is USD

```
client = SteamClient(self.credentials.api_key)
item = 'M4A1-S | Cyrex (Factory New)'
client.fetch_price(item, game=GameOptions.CS)
{'volume': '208', 'lowest_price': '$11.30 USD', 'median_price': '$11.33 USD', 'success': True}
```

**get_my_inventory(self, game: GameOptions) -> dict**

Using `SteamClient.login` method is required before usage

Test
====

All public methods are documented and tested. 
`guard` module has unit tests, `client` uses an acceptance test.
For the acceptance test you have to put `credentials.pwd` and `Steamguard` file into `test` directory.

Example `credentials.pwd` file:

```
account1 password1 api_key1
account2 password2 api_key2
```

In some tests you also have to obtain `transaction_id`.
You can do it by `SteamClient.get_trade_offers` or by logging manually into steam account in browser and get it from url
